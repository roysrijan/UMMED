            <h2>What Is Financial Literacy?</h2>
            <p>
                Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including
                personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. Financial literacy is the foundation of your
                relationship with money, and it is a lifelong journey of learning. The earlier you start, the better off
                you will be, because education is the key to success when it comes to money.</p>
            <p>Read on to discover how you can become financially literate and able to navigate the challenging but
                critical waters of personal finance. And when you have educated yourself, try to pass your knowledge on
                to your family and friends. Many people find money matters intimidating, but they don’t have to be, so
                spread the news by example.</p>
            <h2>Strategies to Improve Your Financial Literacy Skills</h2>
            <p>Developing financial literacy to improve your personal finances involves learning and practicing a
                variety of skills related to budgeting, managing and paying off debts, and understanding credit and
                investment products. Here are several practical strategies to consider.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create a Budget</strong>—Track how much money you receive each month against how much you
                    spend in an Excel sheet, on paper, or with a budgeting app. Your budget should include income
                    (paychecks, investments, alimony), fixed expenses (rent/mortgage payments, utilities, loan
                    payments), discretionary spending (nonessentials such as eating out, shopping, and travel), and
                    savings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pay Yourself First</strong>—To build savings, this reverse budgeting strategy involves
                    choosing a savings goal (say, a down payment for a home), deciding how much you want to contribute
                    toward it each month, and setting that amount aside before you divvy up the rest of your expenses.
